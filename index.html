<h1> Ryan Cleary </h1>
<h2> I am seeking full time employment in the field of computer engineering. I have experience in systemverilog programming with  fpgas. I also have experience programming microprocessors using embedded C. In microprocessor system design I have experience with all of the basic peripherals including DMA, communication protocols SPI, I2C, and UART, timers, ADC and DAC. I also have experience using the FreeRTOS on and ESP32 microcontroller.

<h3>Dijkstra's algorithm</h3>
<p>In this project I implemented dijkstras algorithm in order to find the shortest path between nodes in a test file. The largest test file contains a nodal representation of interestate interesections inthe united states and contains almonst 100,000 nodes. My program is able to find the shortest path in less than one second and is both efficient in memort use and has no memory errors. My implementation works by using a min heap to keep track of the current shortest path while using a hash table to efficiently look up the nodes that it encounters.</p>

<h3>Senior Design</h3>
<p>In this project, entitled Smartbike, I worked with my team to develop a system to track user metrics and display them in real time. The technologies we used to complete this project were, ESP32 micocontroller, GPS module, hall effect sensor, ekg sensor. On the ESP32 we used the RTOS operating system. Also, I interfaced with the ADC, the pulse detector, and the UART. </p>

<h3>Python for Data Science</h3>
<p>Final project for the course where we implemented machine learning models to predict bike ridership on bridges in manhattan. The project involved choosing a model, analyzing its effectiveness at the task, and feature discovery. </p>

<h3>processor design lab</h3>
<p>A full semester project done in pairs to design a five stage multicore processor for a subset of the MIPS ISA. The project also included branch prediction, cache coherence protocols, and synchronization primitives.</p>
