<h3>Dijkstra's algorithm</h3>
<p>In this project I implemented dijkstras algorithm in order to find the shortest path between nodes in a test file. The largest test file contains a nodal representation of interestate interesections inthe united states and contains almonst 100,000 nodes. My program is able to find the shortest path in less than one second and is both efficient in memort use and has no memory errors. My implementation works by using a min heap to keep track of the current shortest path while using a hash table to efficiently look up the nodes that it encounters.</p>
